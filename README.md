# colorize
Colorizes the output from a cli command and adds a colorized status line indicating success or failure. 

I built this to use in makefiles so that the output was more readability. I often use, and would prefer to use, 
make to bundle js and css for website development. But I don't like giving up the nice colored output that gulp provides.

So I decided to build this little utility.

It also gave me an oportunity to refresh my 'c' programming and experiment with 'object oriented programming' in 'c'.

# Usage

  colorize ls -al
